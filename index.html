      <p>Hello! I am very excited coming here to learn Web Development and would like to change my career. Originally from Beijing China, I came to US in 1999 for the graduate study of Computer Vision and Image Processing and then worked as an Electrical/Software engineer in the display industry in St. Louis area for about 15 years before moving to San Diego in 2016.</p>

      <p>I always want to be an IT professional and focus on solving programming puzzles. It is great to finally have the chance to make the change.</p>

      <p>I like travelling and hanging out with my 10-year old daugther. Getting to know different people and places as well as tasting various delicious food are always enjoyable.</p>
